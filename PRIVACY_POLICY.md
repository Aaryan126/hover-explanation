# Privacy Policy for Hov3x

**Last Updated:** November 19, 2024

## Introduction

Hov3x ("we," "our," or "the extension") is a Chrome browser extension that provides AI-powered explanations for technical terms. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Text Selections
When you select text on a webpage and our extension is active:
- **What we collect:** The specific text you select (limited to 100 characters)
- **How we use it:** To generate explanations via Google's Gemini AI API
- **Where it goes:** Your selected text is sent to our secure proxy server, which forwards it to Google's Gemini API
- **How long we keep it:** Selected text is NOT stored permanently. It is only transmitted for processing and then discarded

### 2. Cached Explanations
- **What we collect:** AI-generated explanations for terms you've looked up
- **Where it's stored:** Locally in your browser's Chrome storage (never on our servers)
- **How long we keep it:** 7 days, after which cached items expire automatically
- **Your control:** You can clear the cache at any time via the extension popup

### 3. Extension Settings
- **What we collect:** Your preferences (theme choice, service enabled/disabled status)
- **Where it's stored:** Locally in your browser's Chrome storage only
- **No transmission:** These settings never leave your device

### 4. Technical Information
Our proxy server may temporarily log:
- IP addresses (for rate limiting and abuse prevention only)
- Request timestamps
- Error messages (for debugging and service improvement)

**Retention:** Technical logs are kept for a maximum of 30 days and are automatically deleted.

## How We Use Your Information

1. **Provide the Service:** To generate AI explanations for selected text

3. **Prevent Abuse:** To implement rate limiting and block malicious usage
4. **Debug Issues:** To diagnose and fix technical problems

## Data Security

We implement security measures to protect your information:
